== Changelog ==

You can find the changelog @ https://github.com/welaika/wordless/releases

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.0.0 =

* Haml is no longer supported
* This version of wordless is not compatible with theme structure from <3.0.0.
  It's up to you to adapt your folders accordingly if you'd like to update the plugin.

= 2.6.1 =

Added helper for Gutenberg/ACF blocks.

= 2.5 =

* Old ruby preprocessors are no more activated by default. Please refer to
the changelog for more info.

= 0.5 =

* WARNING! Version 0.5 is not backward compatible! Wordless had always used `yield()` function in its template; starting from some point yield() become a reseved PHP function, so we had to rename it in Wordless code. If you get errors search and replace `yield()` inside the pugin directory with `wl_yield()`. Sorry for the inconvenient.
